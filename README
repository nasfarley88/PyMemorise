Current version matches and corrects words and simple mistakes for phrases!

Future versions
 - Need to reinstate punctuation when reconstructing the phrase
 - Possibly find a better way to output the phrase in the terminal
   = Maybe restrict it to 80 char and put markers on every line indicating 
     if there is an error present.
 - More robust error checking, checking in other places for the same phrase
   etc.
